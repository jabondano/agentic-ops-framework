# Pillar 2: Knowledge Capture

**Workforce-as-training-data philosophy**

---

## Overview

Knowledge Capture is the systematic process of documenting institutional expertise, processes, and tribal knowledge in formats that AI agents can understand and apply. Your workforce's collective intelligence becomes the foundation for AI effectiveness.

## Core Principles

### 2.1 The Three Layers of Organizational Knowledge

1. **Explicit Knowledge** — Documented processes, policies, and procedures
2. **Implicit Knowledge** — Skills and habits that people demonstrate but rarely document
3. **Tacit Knowledge** — Intuitions, judgment calls, and "gut feelings" that drive decisions

Most organizations only capture Layer 1. Agentic operations require all three.

### 2.2 Capture Methodology

<!-- TODO: Add interview guides and examples -->

**Step 1: Process Documentation**
- Map workflows from trigger to completion
- Document decision points and criteria
- Capture exceptions and edge cases

**Step 2: Expert Interviews**
- "Walk me through your typical day"
- "What makes someone great at this job?"
- "What do you wish new hires understood faster?"

**Step 3: Decision Archaeology**
- Review past decisions and their outcomes
- Document the reasoning behind key choices
- Identify patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful outcomes

### 2.3 The Documentation Hierarchy

```
├── Division Overview
│   ├── Mission & Responsibilities
│   ├── Key Metrics
│   └── Stakeholder Map
├── Processes (SOPs)
│   ├── Standard Workflows
│   ├── Exception Handling
│   └── Escalation Procedures
├── Systems
│   ├── Tools & Access
│   ├── Data Sources
│   └── Integration Points
└── Expertise
    ├── Decision Frameworks
    ├── Quality Standards
    └── Tribal Knowledge
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify knowledge holders per division
- [ ] Schedule capture sessions (interviews, shadowing)
- [ ] Create documentation templates
- [ ] Establish review and validation process
- [ ] Set up knowledge maintenance cadence

## Capture Techniques

### Technique 1: Process Mining

<!-- TODO: Expand with tools and methods -->

Analyze system logs and workflow data to understand actual vs. documented processes.

### Technique 2: Think-Aloud Protocols

<!-- TODO: Add interview script -->

Have experts verbalize their reasoning while performing tasks.

### Technique 3: Decision Journaling

<!-- TODO: Create template -->

Experts log decisions and reasoning in real-time for later analysis.

## Quality Standards

Good knowledge documentation should be:

- **Specific** — Concrete enough for an AI to follow
- **Complete** — Covers standard cases and edge cases
- **Current** — Reflects how work is actually done today
- **Accessible** — Written in clear, jargon-free language

## Deliverables

1. **Knowledge Inventory** — Catalog of captured expertise by division
2. **Process Library** — Complete SOP documentation
3. **System Documentation** — Technical specs for all integrated tools
4. **Custom Instructions** — AI-ready synthesis of knowledge
